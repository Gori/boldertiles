# The Concept: Plan Mode as an “Idea Engine”

Not a planner.
Not a brainstorming tool.
Not a roadmap generator.

An **engine** that:

* Converts vague intention → structured opportunity
* Converts scattered ideas → product shape
* Converts ambition → constrained action
* Applies pressure where needed
* Advances the idea even when you stall

It has a backbone (5 phases), but what makes it special is:

> It actively manages idea energy.

---

# Core Principle: Energy Management

Every idea has energy in three dimensions:

1. Clarity
2. Differentiation
3. Feasibility

Most founders over-index one:

* High clarity, low differentiation → boring.
* High differentiation, low feasibility → fantasy.
* High feasibility, low clarity → directionless.

This system tracks these implicitly.

Every phase increases one dimension without collapsing the others.

---

# The 5-Phase Backbone (Rebuilt Properly)

We keep:

Ingest → Expand → Shape → Scope → Commit

But redefine their purpose.

---

## 1. INGEST → Extract the Core Vector

Not “clarify.”

Instead:

The system extracts a **core vector**:

* Who benefits?
* What changes?
* Why now?
* What assumption is embedded?

Then it does something subtle but powerful:

It rewrites the idea in three different strategic framings.

Example:

Original:
“AI tool for internal documentation.”

Reframed as:

1. Cost-reduction automation tool
2. Knowledge compounding engine
3. Developer leverage multiplier

Now the founder sees the idea differently.

That’s magic.
But practical.

---

## 2. EXPAND → Generate Structured Contrast

Not random creativity.

The system expands across fixed axes:

* Narrow vs Broad audience
* Manual-first vs Fully automated
* Workflow tool vs Outcome tool
* Invisible vs Opinionated
* Fast to ship vs Hard to copy

It produces variants across these axes.

The key mechanic:

It forces elimination.

The user must discard at least one direction.

Expansion without elimination is drift.

---

## 3. SHAPE → Define Product Character

This is where it becomes real.

The system extracts:

* Core loop
* Signature move (what makes it memorable)
* Dependency surface (what it relies on)
* Non-goals

It explicitly asks for:

Two things this product will not optimize.

This prevents generic SaaS drift.

This phase is about character, not features.

---

## 4. SCOPE → Apply Constraint Pressure

This is where it gets practical.

Instead of just Must/Should/Could, the system applies three pressure filters:

### 1. Solo Reality Filter

What can be built in 14 days?

### 2. Signal Filter

Which feature proves this idea works?

### 3. Regret Filter

What would you regret excluding?

Features must survive at least two filters.

That’s disciplined, not fluffy.

---

## 5. COMMIT → Define Forward Motion

Instead of roadmap:

It outputs:

* 3 testable claims
* 1 risky bet
* 1 fast validation path
* 1 thing to manually fake
* 1 thing to ignore for 30 days

This is founder-operational.

---

# Where It Feels Magical

Now the important part.

The system must behave differently depending on idea quality.

It should detect:

* Vagueness
* Overconfidence
* Safe choices
* Feature bloat
* Avoidance

But instead of asking more questions, it does one of three things:

---

## Behavior A: Strategic Rewrite

If the idea is weak or derivative:

It rewrites it sharper.

> Here’s a more focused version of what you might actually be building.

This reframing often saves 30 minutes of wandering.

---

## Behavior B: Forced Compression

If things get bloated:

It compresses:

> If this were a 1-feature product, what would it be?

And then re-derives the plan around that.

---

## Behavior C: Risk Surfacing

If feasibility is ignored:

> This hinges entirely on X working.
> If X fails, the idea collapses.

It surfaces the linchpin.

That’s extremely valuable.

---

# The Real Differentiator: Adaptive Pressure

The system should not apply the same intensity every time.

It modulates:

Low signal → increases structure.
High creativity → increases constraint.
High ambition → increases feasibility checks.
Over-cautious → injects bold variant.

This makes it feel alive.

Not scripted.

---

# It Should Feel Like:

Not chat.
Not a document.
Not a form.

But a session.

A contained thinking sprint.

You enter with noise.
You leave with:

* Clear product shape
* Differentiation anchor
* Scoped MVP
* Known risks
* Forward action

That’s the promise.

---

# Open-Ended Enough for a Better Team

This design deliberately avoids:

* Specific UI layouts
* Specific components
* Graph mechanics
* Over-specified flows

Instead it defines:

* Cognitive phases
* Pressure mechanics
* Behavioral triggers
* Strategic interventions
* Output guarantees

A strong team can:

* Turn this into a canvas
* Turn this into an IDE mode
* Turn this into a guided lab
* Turn this into a hybrid system

The architecture is flexible.


Good. Here’s a proper creative brief — something you can hand to a serious product + engineering team.

No fluff. No UI prescription. Clear ambition.

---

# Creative Brief

## Project: Plan Mode — The Idea Engine

---

## 1. Vision

Build a next-generation “Plan Mode” that transforms vague startup ideas into differentiated, scoped, testable product directions.

This is not a chat assistant.
Not a roadmap generator.
Not a feature list machine.

It is a structured thinking engine for founders.

When someone enters with scattered thoughts, they should leave with:

* A clear product shape
* Explicit differentiation
* A realistic MVP
* Known risks
* A forward path

It should feel like working with a sharp strategist who quietly improves your thinking.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Startup ideation today suffers from three failure modes:

1. **Generic Drift**
   Ideas default to obvious SaaS patterns.

2. **Feature Bloat**
   Early concepts become bloated before validation.

3. **Premature Convergence**
   Founders narrow too early without exploring meaningful alternatives.

Existing AI tools:

* Over-clarify
* Over-generate
* Over-flatten
* Lose decision state
* Don’t enforce constraint

We are building a system that introduces:

* Structured divergence
* Intentional elimination
* Differentiation pressure
* Constraint sculpting
* Regret modeling

Without becoming rigid or enterprise-heavy.

---

## 3. Target User

Primary:

* Solo founders
* Technical builders
* Early-stage startup teams (1–3 people)

Secondary:

* Indie hackers
* AI-native product builders
* Exploratory product designers

This is not built for:

* Enterprise PM workflows
* Large-team backlog management
* Corporate requirement gathering

This is for builders thinking from zero.

---

## 4. Core Outcome

If this works perfectly:

Founders will build:

* More differentiated products
* Smaller, sharper MVPs
* Fewer dead-end builds

And they will:

* Make decisions faster
* See risks earlier
* Cut unnecessary features
* Understand their product’s identity

---

## 5. Core Experience Model

The system follows a 5-phase backbone:

1. Ingest — Extract and sharpen intent
2. Expand — Generate structured contrast
3. Shape — Define product character
4. Scope — Apply constraint pressure
5. Commit — Convert into testable action

The power is not in the phases.
The power is in how pressure is applied inside each.

---

## 6. Experience Principles

### 1. Structured but Not Rigid

Clear phases, but not bureaucratic.

### 2. Elimination Over Addition

Progress requires cutting options, not adding them.

### 3. Differentiation Is Mandatory

Every idea must answer:
“What makes this meaningfully different?”

### 4. Assumptions Must Be Visible

No silent inference.
Critical assumptions are surfaced before commitment.

### 5. Constraint Is a Feature

14-day filters.
Manual-first suggestions.
Forced reduction moments.

### 6. Pressure Is Proportional

Generic idea → sharper pressure.
Strong idea → lighter touch.

---

## 7. Tone

* Calm
* Precise
* Economical
* Occasionally provocative
* Never verbose
* Never motivational

It should feel:
Collaborative, but with edge.

Like someone who sees around corners.

---

## 8. What Makes This Different

This is not:

* A brainstorming tool.
* A document generator.
* A UI playground.
* A roadmap wizard.

It is:

A decision-shaping engine.

It manages:

* Energy
* Focus
* Scope
* Risk
* Differentiation

It adapts when the founder stalls.
It proposes direction when indecision appears.
It compresses when scope bloats.

It feels intelligent, not reactive.

---

## 9. Design Tensions (To Embrace, Not Resolve)

1. Exploration vs Commitment
2. Creativity vs Constraint
3. Differentiation vs Feasibility
4. Founder Freedom vs System Pressure
5. Clarity vs Optionality

The system should not eliminate these tensions.
It should surface them.

---

## 10. Non-Goals

* No enterprise workflow modeling.
* No detailed technical architecture generation.
* No code writing in Plan Mode.
* No infinite idea trees.
* No gamified brainstorming.

This is not about producing more.
It is about producing sharper.

---

## 11. Success Criteria

Qualitative:

* Users say: “It caught something I missed.”
* Users remove features they initially loved.
* Users articulate clearer positioning.
* Users identify risks earlier.

Quantitative (early signals):

* Average feature count decreases through session.
* At least one variant is eliminated per session.
* Each session produces testable hypotheses.
* Sessions result in defined 7–14 day action plans.

---

## 12. What “Magic” Means Here

Magic is not visual novelty.

Magic is:

* Smart reframing.
* Timely intervention.
* Strategic compression.
* Sharp rewrite.
* Revealed assumption.
* Forced clarity.

When the founder is unclear,
the system advances the idea anyway.

When the founder is stuck,
the system proposes a path.

When the founder is overconfident,
the system surfaces risk.

That is the bar.

---

## 13. The Standard We’re Competing Against

If this system doesn’t outperform:

* A smart founder with a blank Notion page
* A whiteboard session
* A ChatGPT brainstorming session

Then it fails.

It must materially improve thinking.

---

## 14. The Ideal End State

A founder enters with:

“I have this vague AI idea…”

They leave with:

* A differentiated product concept
* A narrowed audience
* A scoped MVP
* Clear hypotheses
* A next build step
* A known biggest risk

And they feel:

“Okay. That’s sharp. Let’s build.”
